                           <p class="col-pp">Beautiful Bangladesh is a small country in South Asia & that’s where I am from.</p>
                           <p class="col-pp">Being an only child in a broken family doesn’t help – but I have had an awesome life and things turned out pretty okay.</p>
                            <p class="col-pp">I grew up in a small village, surrounded by the natural beauty
                               of the countryside. Despite its size, my village had many layers, each with its own
                               unique culture and traditions. Growing up, I was always
                               fascinated by the world of technology, and I was particularly drawn to the world of Internet programming.

                              As the only child in my family, I had plenty of time to pursue my interests and hobbies. <br> <br> I spent countless hours teaching myself how to code and create websites, experimenting with different programming languages and platforms. It was a challenging and rewarding pursuit, and it gave me a sense of accomplishment that I still carry with me to this day.
                              
                              Despite my love for technology, I never lost sight of the importance of family and community. My village was a tight-knit and supportive place, where everyone knew each other and looked out for one another. <br> <br> I feel grateful for the values and sense of belonging that I gained from growing up in such an environment.
                              
                              Overall, my childhood was a time of exploration, growth, and discovery. It gave me a solid foundation for the person I am today, and I am excited to continue to learn and grow as I pursue my passions and goals.</p>

              <p class="col-pp">I currently spend about 12 hours programming to become proficient. 
                And spend the rest of the time on the project. I keep myself updated constantly. Programming is a part of my life.
                 Currently I am working on website development and working on social media.
                 I am advancing myself in tune with the present.</p>

              <br> 
              <p class="col-pp">I often ask myself this very question.</p>
              <p class="col-pp">Why am I doing what I am doing? </p>
              <p class="col-pp">Is it because of the money? </p>
              <br>
              <p class="col-pp">It didn't happen.</p>
              
              <p class="col-pp">For me, my purpose in life is not about making money or accumulating wealth. Instead, my true passion lies in helping people through technology and programming.
                 I believe that I have a unique set of skills and talents that I can use to make a positive 
                impact on the world, and that's what drives me every day.
              </p>
              <p class="col-pp">My dream is to lead the way in using technology to help people 
                in need. Whether it's designing software to assist healthcare
                 workers, creating educational tools to empower learners, or building platforms to connect people from all walks of life, I want to use my programming 
                skills to make a tangible difference in people's lives.</p>
                <br>
              <p class="col-pp">But my dream isn't just about the technical aspects of programming. It's also about changing people's perspectives about what technology can do.
                 Too often, we see technology as a means to make money or entertain ourselves, rather than as a tool for creating positive change. I want to lead
                  by example and show people that technology can be used for good,
                 and that we can all play a role in making the world a better place.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p class="col-pp">Of course, reaching my goal won't be easy. It will require
                   hard work, dedication, and a willingness to learn and grow 
                   along the way. But I believe that with perseverance and a 
                   commitment to my values, I can make a real difference in the 
                   world. And in the end, I know that loving and helping 
                  people is the most important thing I can do with my life.</p>
